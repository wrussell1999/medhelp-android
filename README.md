# MedHelp

## Current ideas
- Notifications to take medication
- Notifications a week before medication is due to run out so more can be prescribed
- Schedule view to see when medications need to be taken
- Help manage medications that are taken until otherwise or just for a short time period
- Help space out medications taken several times a day (pain killers, antibiotics)
- Add descriptions to medication to help remind the user what requirements the medication has (take with food, take without food, etc.
